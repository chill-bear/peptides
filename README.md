# DeepQSAR-Based Antimicrobial Peptide Discovery



## üìò Overview

This work introduces a DeepQSAR pipeline that combines a regression model and a recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activity of peptides. By applying this model to 50,000 candidate sequences derived from the UniProt database, we identified 100 peptides for synthesis and validation. Among them, 29 peptides outperformed a known AMP control (IDR-1018) in both anti-biofilm and antimicrobial activities.
