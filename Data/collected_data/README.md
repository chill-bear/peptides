### ðŸ“Š Data Sources

The public antimicrobial peptide (AMP) datapoints used in this project are collected from the following three resources:

1. **[DRAMP (Database of Antimicrobial Peptides)](http://dramp.cpu-bioinfor.org/)**  
   DRAMP is a comprehensive database that provides curated information on antimicrobial peptides, including sequences, activities, and structural data.

2. **[AI4AMP](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msystems.00299-21)**  
   Data were obtained as referenced in the *Data Availability* section of the AI4AMP paper published in *mSystems*. The dataset is designed for machine learning applications in AMP activity prediction.

3. **[DBAASP (Database of Antimicrobial Activity and Structure of Peptides)](https://dbaasp.org/home)**  
   DBAASP offers a wide collection of AMP sequences with detailed annotations on antimicrobial activity and peptide structure.
